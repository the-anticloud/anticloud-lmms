## What this project gives you

A complete worked example of offline-first packaging with a cryptographic audit
chain: source pinned at `a2f57e70ce9c3468b4b6d21955bbe65a0989048a`, a 16-check assurance suite, an evidence register
with per-check hashes, and an AIOSS ledger chain ending at `45250e175bb6f19446366ca2f071e067f6b8ed5746d049ad0e94b67a27b80a94`.

## Learn by verifying

```
python tools/run_bench.py --out BENCH.json
```

Then take any row from `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md`, recompute
the SHA3-256 of its evidence file, and confirm it matches. If it does not match,
the record has been altered — that is the whole point of the chain.
